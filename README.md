# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-PYTHON
Images classified as having tumors were considered for this part of the problem. Image processing was carried out using the OpenCV library in python .
The image was converted to Grayscale and the obtained image was used for thresholding.Thresholding is a technique in OpenCV, which is the assignment of pixel values in relation to the threshold value provided. In thresholding, each pixel value is compared with the threshold value. If the pixel value is smaller than the threshold, it is set to 0, otherwise, it is set to a maximum value.Morphological transformations are simple operations based on the image shape. They are normally performed on binary images. They need two inputs, one is the original image and the second one is called a structuring element or kernel which decides the nature of the operation.The morphological operators used are Erosion and Dilation.
Erosion erodes away the boundaries of foreground object Thus we have used this to remove the small white noises.
Canny Edge Detector
Canny edge detection is carried out on the image to find the outline of the Tumor. Auto _canny function is defined to automatically calculate the lower and upper threshold values.Contours are defined as the line joining all the points along the boundary of an image that are having the same intensity. Contours come handy in shape analysis, finding the size of the object of interest, and object detection.
